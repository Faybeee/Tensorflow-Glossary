# Tensorflow-Glossary
This is a little rubbishy open office "excel" file but honestly, I could actually read the tutorial without feeling like it was a different language once I got through these definitions.
warning:  I am not a data scientist, if these are wrong I apologise.
If you think of a better definition for any of these or think of another one that could be useful, share the love, edit the file.
I have googled pretty much all of these and now I'm exhausted.  Best of luck xxx
